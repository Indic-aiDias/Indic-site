## Deep Learning: Classics and Trends

[Deep Learning: Classics and Trends (DLCT)](/dlct/) is the longest running Indic event. It started in 2018 as a paper reading group and has almost never missed a week since. The vibe is interactive, causal, free-flow and unfettered. **[Subscribe with your email](https://groups.google.com/g/deep-learning-classics-trends)** to get notified weekly.

## Research Jams

The Research Jam is a research lab meeting open to all. Anyone is welcome to share small updates on what they're working on, or present an idea as a [Request for Plot (RFP)](/rfp/). All of our jams are recorded and shared on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfeYlJzwvDN2rBulI6eiOifGH70PjRs6V). Curious to know more?

## Conference Socials

We host Open Collaboration Socials at major ML conferences. During our [inaugural event](/neurips-2020-open-collab-social/) at NeurIPS 2020, we held a panel discussion on the importance of collaboration, an icebreaker session to randomly match people to meet and greet, and a gather.town hangout with focused topics led by pioneers of the field. We are always looking for co-organizers for our conference social.
