## Donate to MLC

Since its inception, **ML Collective** has brought together machine learning researchers around the world. In many cases, we do this in a way that costs nothing but coordination between humans:  

- Gathering  
- Mentoring  
- Coding  
- Training  
- Plotting  
- Reading papers  
- Discussing results  
- Writing papers  
- Presenting results  
- Growing as a researcher  

We are happy to report that these are all free!

### Why Donate?

However, other activities do come at some expense:  

- Setting up large video calls  
- Hosting [events](https://mlcollective.org/events/#social) (e.g., at [NeurIPS](https://mlcollective.org/neurips-2020-open-collab-social/), [ICML](https://mlcollective.org/events/icml-2021-open-collab-social/), and [ICLR](https://mlcollective.org/events/iclr-2024-social/))  
- [Supporting researchers to travel to conferences](https://donorbox.org/mlc-support-deep-learning-indaba)  
- [Setting up researchers with access to GPUs](https://mlcollective.org/wiki/ask-mlc-compute-assistance/)  

These activities are supported by **donations** from people like you. We are grateful for these donations and honored to be able to use them to have as large an impact per dollar as possible.

### How to Donate

There are a few ways you can donate:

1. **Corporate Donation Portals**  
   - If your company has an internal donation portal (possibly with company matching), search for `"ML Collective"` or our EIN: **85-2682932**.  
   - For example, at Google, we are available via [Benevity](https://google.benevity.org).  
   - If **Indic** is not listed in your company's portal, you can probably request us to be added by submitting our EIN.  

2. **ACH or Wire Transfers**  
   - To donate via ACH or Wire directly, [submit this form](https://forms.gle/WABB2Q3683Ut4zZD8).  

3. **Venmo**  
   - Send to user [@ml_collective](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=3450740907443332531).  

4. **Credit Card**  
   - Use the embedded donation form below:

### Tax Deductibility

All donations are **tax-deductible** in the US.  

- If you donate via most of the approaches above, you should receive an **emailed tax receipt**.  
- If you haven't (e.g., if you donated via Venmo) or if you have any other questions, send us an email at:  
  `hello at mlcollective dot org`
